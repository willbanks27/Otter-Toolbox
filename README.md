fade - designed to apply a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the end of an input signal, sn, in order to smooth out abrupt spikes that can sometimes occur at the start and end of signals. The function takes two inputs: sn, the signal to be modified, and fadeLen, which specifies the length of the fade (both for the fade-in and fade-out). Inside the function, a ramp is created that gradually increases from 0 to 1 at the beginning of the signal and decreases from 1 to 0 at the end. The ramp is then applied to the signal by multiplying the signal values with corresponding fade values at the start and end. The function outputs the modified signal (out) with the fade applied, as well as the ramp used (ramp). This helps to reduce discontinuities at the signal boundaries by ensuring smooth transitions.
